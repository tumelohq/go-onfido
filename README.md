> This library was built for Utility Warehouse internal projects, so priority was given to supporting the
features we needed. If the library is missing a feature from the API, raise an issue or ideally open a PR.

## Installation

To install go-onfido, use `go get`:

```
go get github.com/uw-labs/go-onfio
```

## Usage

First you're going to need to instantiate a client (grab your [sandbox API key](https://onfido.com/dashboard/v2/#/api/tokens))

```golang
client := onfido.NewClient("test_123")
```

Or you can instantiate usign the env variable `ONFIDO_TOKEN`

```golang
client, err := onfido.NewClientFromEnv()
```

Now checkout some of the [examples](https://github.com/tumelohq/go-onfido/tree/master/examples)
